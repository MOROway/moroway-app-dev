# MOROway App Development

## General

This repository provides the build tools for MOROway App. The code here is used to build the read-to-use versions of MOROway App.

## Platforms

* The "web"-platform is the main platform and can be used with any web browser. The ready-to-use code for the "web"-platform can be found [here](https://github.com/MOROway/moroway-app).
* The "windows"-platform provides the PWA available at Microsoft Store.
* The "android"-platform is used within the Java-wrapper-app available at Google Play Store. The wrapper app is not open-source.
* The "oc"-platform is used for the Apache Cordova App available at F-Droid. The Cordova wrapper can be found [here](https://github.com/MOROway/moroway-app-oc). This Cordova wrapper contains a [already built version](https://github.com/MOROway/moroway-app-oc/moroway-app-oc) of the "oc"-platform.
